# TrustTunnel endpoint

## Building the library

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85 or higher: use a preferred way from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- libclang 9.0 or higher

### Building

Execute the following commands in the Terminal:

```shell
cargo build
```

to build the debug version, or

```shell
cargo build --release
```

to build the release version.

## Features description

### Traffic forwarding

As for now, the endpoint can demultiplex client's connections multiplexed in either HTTP/1, or
HTTP/2, or HTTP/3 session. An application can set up how the endpoint forwards the demultiplexed
client's connection by setting `Settings.forward_protocol`. The available options
(see `settings.ForwardProtocolSettings`) are:

- routing a connection directly to its target host
- routing a connection though a SOCKS5 proxy

#### ICMP forwarding

As an optional feature, the endpoint can also forward ICMP packets from a client. This feature
can be set up by setting `Settings.icmp`. An application MUST set up an interface name to bind
the ICMP socket to, and MAY tweak some other settings, like the timeouts and message queue size.

### Reverse proxy

Client's connection is treated as a reverse proxy stream in the following cases:

1) A TLS session or QUIC connection has the SNI set to the host name equal to one
   from `TlsHostsSettings.reverse_proxy`.
2) An HTTP/1.1 request has `Upgrade` header and its path starts with `ReverseProxySettings.path_mask`.
3) An HTTP/3 request has a path starting with `ReverseProxySettings.path_mask`.

The stream is used for mutual client and endpoint notifications and some control messages.
The endpoint does TLS termination on such connections and translates HTTP/x traffic into
HTTP/1.1 protocol towards the server and back into original HTTP/x towards the client.
Like this:

```(client) TLS(HTTP/x) <--(endpoint)--> (server) HTTP/1.1```

The translated HTTP/1.1 requests have the custom header `X-Original-Protocol` appended.
For now, its value can be either `HTTP1`, or `HTTP3`.

### Authentication

#### Client authentication options

##### SNI authentication

A client connects to the endpoint with SNI set to `hash.domain_name`, where:

- `hash` - `md5(application_id + ':' + token + ':' + credentials)`
- `domain_name` - the endpoint's original domain name (e.g. `myvpn.org`)

##### Proxy authentication

A client connects to the endpoint using the proxy HTTP authentication mechanism with
the "basic" scheme: `Proxy-Authorization: Basic base64(token + ':' + credentials)`.

#### Endpoint authentication methods

An application can set up the authentication method being used by the endpoint
by setting `Settings.authenticator`. The application can provide its own authenticator
implementation (see the `authentication.Authenticator` trait), or use one of the implementations
provided by the library:

- `authentication.DummyAuthenticator` - authenticates any request
- `authentication.file_based.FileBasedAuthenticator` - authenticates a request basing on
  the file containing credentials ([see here](#file-based-authenticator))
- SOCKS5 authentication - delegates authentication to the SOCKS5 forwarder ([see here](#socks5-authenticator))

**Please note**, that the first 2 are very simple authenticator implementations which are intended
mostly for testing purposes and do not respect network security practices.

##### File based authenticator

The file must contain an application id (`applicationId: <string>`), token (`token: <string>`),
and credentials (`credentials: <string>`).
Each one must be on a new line. The order does not matter.

##### SOCKS5 authenticator

###### Standard authentication

In case `Socks5ForwarderSettings.extended_auth` is set to false, the endpoint performs
the standard authentication procedure according to the
[RFC 1929](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1929).

Depending on the client-side authentication way, the username and password are as follows:

- [SNI authentication](#sni-authentication):
    - both `username` and `password` = `hash` - corresponds to `hash`, as in
    [SNI authentication](#sni-authentication)

- [Proxy authentication](#proxy-authentication):
    - `username` corresponds to `token`, as in [Proxy authentication](#proxy-authentication)
    - `password` corresponds to `credentials`, as in [Proxy authentication](#proxy-authentication)

###### Extended authentication

The extended authentication uses `0x80` as an authentication method.
After a server selects this authentication method, a client sends an authentication
request in the following format:

```text
+-----+-----------+-----+--------+
| VER |   EXT(0)  |     | EXT(n) |
+-----+-----------+ ... +--------+
|  1  | see below |     |        |
+-----+-----------+-----+--------+
```

Where:

- `VER` - the current extended authentication version: 0x01
- `EXT[i]` - an extension in the following format:

   ```text
   +------+--------+----------+
   | TYPE | LENGTH |   VALUE  |
   +------+--------+----------+
   |  1   |    2   | Variable |
   +------+--------+----------+
   ```

   Where:
    - `TYPE` - a type of the extension value (see [`ExtendedAuthenticationValue`])
    - `LENGTH` - the length of the extension value
    - `VALUE` - the extension value

Available extensions:

- `TERM`: type = 0x00, length = 0 - terminating extension, marks a message end
- `DOMAIN`: type = 0x01, length = (0..MAX], value = UTF-8 string - hostname which
  a client used for the TLS session (SNI)
- `CLIENT_ADDRESS`: type = 0x02, length = [4|16], value = Bytes - public IP
  address of the VPN client
- `USER_AGENT`: type = 0x03, length = (0..MAX], value = UTF-8 string - user agent of the VPN client
- `PROXY_AUTH`: type = 0x04, length = (0..MAX], value = base64 string - `<credentials>` part of
  [the Proxy-Authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Proxy-Authorization)
- `SNI_AUTH`: type = 0x05, length = 0 - marks that the VPN client tries to authenticate using SNI

A message **MUST** end with the `TERM` extension.

The server responds with a standard message as in [the RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1929#section-2).

### Metrics collecting

In order to collect some metrics of a running endpoint, an application can set up it to listen for
the metrics collecting requests (see `Settings.metrics`). An endpoint running with this feature
will listen on the configured address (`MetricsSettings.address`) for plain HTTP/1 requests.
The following paths are available:

- `/health-check` - used for pinging the endpoint, so it will respond with `200 OK`
- `/metrics` - used for metrics collecting, so it will respond with a bunch of values according to
  [the prometheus specification](https://prometheus.io/)
